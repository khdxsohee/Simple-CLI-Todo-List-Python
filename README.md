# Simple CLI Todo List

A simple yet powerful **command-line interface (CLI) application** for managing your daily tasks. Built with Python, this project demonstrates basic **file I/O**, **list manipulation**, and **command-line interaction**, making it a great starting point for anyone looking to understand fundamental programming concepts.

## Features

* **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your todo list.
* **List All Tasks:** View all your pending and completed tasks.
* **Mark as Complete:** Mark tasks as done when you finish them.
* **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks you no longer need.
* **Persistence:** Your tasks are saved to a file (`todos.txt`), so they're always there when you reopen the application.
